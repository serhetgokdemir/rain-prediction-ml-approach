This project focuses on predicting rainfall using the WeatherAUS dataset. By applying multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, I developed a solution to forecast rain on the next day. The project also includes techniques for handling imbalanced data, such as SMOTE, and model evaluation using ROC curves and AUC scores.
